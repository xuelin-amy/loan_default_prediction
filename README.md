## Predict Loan Defaults

SIB(Small Industries Bank) loans money to companies in exchange for the promise of repayment.  Some will default on the loans, being unable to repay them for some reason. The bank maintains insurance to reduce their risk of loss in the event of default. The insured amount may cover all or just some part of the loan amount.  SIB wants to predict which companies will default on their loans based on their financial information. They have provided you with a dataset that consists of loan related information such as loan amount, term, and state. Also, there is company information such as the number of employees, operating sector, etc.
 
Using machine learning, predict which companies will default on their loans and explain how different features impact the predictions.

## Problem

Analyze the given data and learn how different features are related to and affect default_status. With the given data, build a machine learning model which can be used to predict the â€˜default_status'.
 
For each record in the test set (test.csv), you must predict the value of the default_status variable. You should submit a CSV file with a header row and one row per test entry. The file (submissions.csv) should have exactly 2 columns:

* id
* default_status
